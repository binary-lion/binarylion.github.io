      </p>
      <h3>
        Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to
        object to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)
      </h3>
      <p>
        IN THE EVENT THAT DATA ARE PROCESSED ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6 SECT. 1 LIT.
        E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING
        OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA BASED ON GROUNDS ARISING FROM YOUR UNIQUE
        SITUATION. THIS ALSO APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS.
        TO DETERMINE THE LEGAL BASIS, ON WHICH ANY PROCESSING OF DATA IS BASED,
        PLEASE CONSULT THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU LOG AN
        OBJECTION, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS
        WE ARE IN A POSITION TO PRESENT COMPELLING PROTECTION WORTHY GROUNDS FOR
        THE PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA, THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND
        FREEDOMS OR IF THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCESSING IS THE CLAIMING, EXERCISING
        OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL ENTITLEMENTS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 SECT. 1
        GDPR).
      </p>
      <p>
        IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS BEING PROCESSED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN DIRECT
        ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING
        OF YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH ADVERTISING.
        THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS AFFILIATED WITH
        SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL
        SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING PURPOSES
        (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 SECT. 2 GDPR).
      </p>
      <h3>Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</h3>
      <p>
        In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to
        log a complaint with a supervisory agency, in particular in the member
        state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at
        the place where the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a
        complaint is in effect regardless of any other administrative or court
        proceedings available as legal recourses.
      </p>
      <h3>Right to data portability</h3>
      <p>
        You have the right to demand that we hand over any data we automatically
        process on the basis of your consent or in order to fulfil a contract be
        handed over to you or a third party in a commonly used, machine readable
        format. If you should demand the direct transfer of the data to another
        controller, this will be done only if it is technically feasible.
      </p>
      <h3>SSL and/or TLS encryption</h3>
      <p>
        For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential
        content, such as purchase orders or inquiries you submit to us as the
        website operator, this website uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption
        programme. You can recognise an encrypted connection by checking whether
        the address line of the browser switches from “http://” to “https://”
        and also by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us
        cannot be read by third parties.
      </p>
      <h3>Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h3>
      <p>
        Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the
        right to at any time demand information about your archived personal
        data, their source and recipients as well as the purpose of the
        processing of your data. You may also have a right to have your data
        rectified or eradicated. If you have questions about this subject matter
        or any other questions about personal data, please do not hesitate to
        contact us at any time at the address provided in section “Information
        Required by Law.”
      </p>
      <h3>Right to demand processing restrictions</h3>
      <p>
        You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as
        the processing of your personal data is concerned. To do so, you may
        contact us at any time at the address provided in section “Information
        Required by Law.” The right to demand restriction of processing applies
        in the following cases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data
          archived by us, we will usually need some time to verify this claim.
          During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right
          to demand that we restrict the processing of your personal data.

        <li>
          If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an
          unlawful manner, you have the option to demand the restriction of the
          processing of your data in lieu of demanding the eradication of this
          data.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to
          exercise, defend or claim legal entitlements, you have the right to
          demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead
          of its eradication.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21 Sect. 1 GDPR, your
          rights and our rights will have to be weighed against each other. As
          long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have
          the right to demand a restriction of the processing of your personal
          data.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data
        – with the exception of their archiving – may be processed only subject
        to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal entitlements or to
        protect the rights of other natural persons or legal entities or for
        important public interest reasons cited by the European Union or a
        member state of the EU.

      <h3>Cookies</h3>
      <p>
        Our websites and pages use what the industry refers to as “cookies.”
        Cookies are small text files that do not cause any damage to your
        device. They are either stored temporarily for the duration of a session
        (session cookies) or they are permanently archived on your device
        (permanent cookies). Session cookies are automatically deleted once you
        terminate your visit. Permanent cookies remain archived on your device
        until you actively delete them or they are automatically eradicated by
        your web browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases it is possible that third party cookies are stored on your
        device once you enter our site (third party cookies). These cookies
        enable you or us to take advantage of certain services offered by the
        third party (e.g. cookies for the processing of payment services).
      </p>
      <p>
        Cookies have a variety of functions. Many cookies are technically
        essential since certain website functions would not work in the absence
        of the cookies (e.g. the shopping cart function or the display of
        videos). The purpose of other cookies may be the analysis of user
        patterns or the display of promotional messages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cookies, which are required for the performance of electronic
        communication transactions (required cookies) or for the provision of
        certain functions you want to use (functional cookies, e.g. for the
        shopping cart function) or those that are necessary for the optimization
        of the website (e.g. cookies that provide measurable insights into the
        web audience), shall be stored on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f
        GDPR, unless a different legal basis is cited. The operator of the
        website has a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies to ensure
        the technically error free and optimized provision of the operator’s
        services. If your consent to the storage of the cookies has been
        requested, the respective cookies are stored exclusively on the basis of
        the consent obtained (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a GDPR); this consent may be
        revoked at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        You have the option to set up your browser in such a manner that you
        will be notified any time cookies are placed and to permit the
        acceptance of cookies only in specific cases. You may also exclude the
        acceptance of cookies in certain cases or in general or activate the
        delete function for the automatic eradication of cookies when the
        browser closes. If cookies are deactivated, the functions of this
        website may be limited.

      <p>
        In the event that third party cookies are used or if cookies are used
        for analytical purposes, we will separately notify you in conjunction
        with this Data Protection Policy and, if applicable, ask for your
        consent.

      <h3>Server log files</h3>
      <p>
        The provider of this website and its pages automatically collects and
        stores information in so-called server log files, which your browser
        communicates to us automatically. The information comprises:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The type and version of browser used</li>
        <li>The used operating system</li>
        <li>Referrer URL</li>
        <li>The hostname of the accessing computer</li>
        <li>The time of the server inquiry</li>
        <li>The IP address</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This data is not merged with other data sources.</p>
      <p>
        This data is recorded on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR. The
        operator of the website has a legitimate interest in the technically
        error free depiction and the optimization of the operator’s website. In
        order to achieve this, server log files must be recorded.
      </p>
      <h3>Request by e-mail, telephone or fax</h3>
      <p>
        If you contact us by e-mail, telephone or fax, your request, including
        all resulting personal data (name, request) will be stored and processed
        by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass these
        data on without your consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        These data are processed on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. b GDPR if
        your inquiry is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is required
        for the performance of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the
        data are processed on the basis of our legitimate interest in the
        effective handling of inquiries submitted to us (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f
        GDPR) or on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a GDPR) if it
        has been obtained.
      </p>
      <p>
        The data sent by you to us via contact requests remain with us until you
        request us to delete, revoke your consent to the storage or the purpose
        for the data storage lapses (e.g. after completion of your request).
        Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular statutory retention
        periods - remain unaffected.
